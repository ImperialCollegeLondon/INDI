## Introduction

This software is a post-processing pipeline designed for in-vivo cardiac diffusion tensor imaging.
It currently accepts Siemens and Philips diffusion weighted DICOM data, as well as [anonymised NIFTI data](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/cdti_data_export).
It also supports both STEAM and spin-echo data.

After the data is loaded, the pipeline performs the following steps:

- Image registration
- Image curation
- Tensor fitting
- Segmentation
- Export results

INDI runs from the command line, and when processing a dataset for the first time,
INDI will require user input (pop-up matplotlib windows) which will be saved for future runs.

For more details:

See [documentation](docs/documentation.md) for details on the post-processing pipeline.

See [YAML settings](docs/YAML_settings.md) for run configuration details.

## Installation

Software has been tested on:

- macOS 15.0 with python 3.12
<!-- - Ubuntu 22.04 with python 3.11 -->
- Windows 10 with python 3.12

### Clone the repository

[Install git for your OS](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Then clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/INDI.git
```

#### Installation in macOS (Intel and Apple silicon) with pip

You may need to instal Xcode and Xcodeâ€™s Command Line Tools package as well, with this command:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Then install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

With homebrew install python 3.11:

```bash
brew install python@3.12
```

Also install imagemagick:

```bash
brew install imagemagick
```

Install the python environment in the INDI root directory:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel pip-tools
pip install -r requirements_mac.txt
```

#### Installation in Ubuntu 22.04 with conda

install imagemagick:

```bash
sudo apt install imagemagick
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev
pip-sync requirements_linux.txt
xhost +
    1  python
    2  python3
    3  exit
    4  sudo apt install git-all
    5  sudo apt install build-essential
    6  apt install imagemagik
    7  apt install imagemagick
    8  sudo apt install imagemagick
    9  cd Documents/GitHub/INDI/
   10  python3 -m venv .venv
   11  apt install python3.12-venv
   12  sudo apt install python3.12-venv
   13  python3 -m venv .venv
   14  source .venv/bin/activate
   15  pip install -U pip setuptools wheel pip-tools
   16  pip-compile --output-file=requirements_linux.txt
   17  pip-sync requirements_linux.txt 
   18  python main.py /home/pf/Documents/DTI_data/STEAM_sys/
   19  xhost +
   20  python main.py /home/pf/Documents/DTI_data/STEAM_sys/
   21  pip-compile --output-file=requirements_linux.txt
   22  sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev
   23  pip-compile --output-file=requirements_linux.txt
   24  pip-sync requirements_linux.txt 
   25  python main.py /home/pf/Documents/DTI_data/STEAM_sys/
   26  history

```

Install miniforge:
[Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)

Install the python environment with conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment-cpu.yml
```

Or alternatively, if you have a CUDA compatible GPU for Win or Linux:

```bash
conda env create -f environment-gpu.yml
```

#### Installation Windows 10 with conda

Install miniforge:
[Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)

Create a new environment with conda:

```bash
conda create --name indi python=3.12
conda activate indi
```

Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel pip-tools
pip install -r requirements_win.txt
```

Install [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/).

### For development

#### Install pre-commit

For development, also install the git hook scripts:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Now pre-commit will run automatically on git commit. You can also run it manually with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This is required to ensure code quality and style before committing code changes.

#### Update requirements

The packages are pinned to specific versions in the `requirements.in` file. If you want to update the packages, you can do so with the following command (change the requirements file name according to the OS):

```bash
pip-compile --output-file=requirements_mac.txt
pip-sync requirements_mac.txt
```

## Basic usage example

We are going to post-process a synthetic phantom dataset with non-rigid distortions. Please unzip [the phantom data](docs/test_phantom_cdti_dicoms.zip).

The `test_phantom_cdti_dicoms` folder contains a subfolder named `diffusion_images` with the cdti simulated DICOMs. The DICOM files contain noisy diffusion weighted images with periodic non-rigid distortions, simulating a typical in-vivo scan.

INDI always looks recursively for subfolders named `diffusion_images`. The DICOM files must be inside this folder.

Before running we should have a look at the `settings.yaml` file, and check if the parameters makes sense. See [YAML settings](docs/YAML_settings.md) for more information. For this phantom example, the default settings should be fine.

Then run in the INDI python environment:

```bash
python main.py <data_path>
```

Where `<data_path>` is a folder that must contain at least a subfolder named `diffusion_images` with all the
DICOM files.

In the video tutorial below we show how to run INDI with the phantom data:
